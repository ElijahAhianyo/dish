# dish
another unix shell you dont need (for educational purposes)

Writing a shell is a rite of passage to systems programming. This repo is doing just that.

## How to Run
 To start the shell, compile by running the make command:

 ```sh
  > make all
 ```

 This should generate a `dish` binary in the cwd which you can run using the command:

 ```sh

> ./dish
 ```
